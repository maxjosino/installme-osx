# Setup a new computer can be a pain when you need to get things done faster. This script helps you to get installed most of the relevant apps for Designers on mac OS.

These are just my personal scripts to help me setup a new osx machine.

To start a new setup, simply run:

```shell
bash -c "`curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arthurgouveia/installme-osx/master/setup.sh`"
```
